                                Experience with software development engineering and leadership, I help to streamline processes, build happy and productive technical teams. 
                                As a long-time technical leader and mentor, I enjoy raising programming proficiency in my free time as much as mentoring new leaders.
                                My end-goal is to create good business impact for the company and clients that I work with as well as increase value for end-users.

                                I enjoy working with software engineers team, executive team and clients. My quote is
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        "Love what you do so you don't have to work a day"

                                To be honest, I experienced it's damn true
                                about it; I often build success projects around motivated and happy people. Oh, yeah !

                                I enjoy reading technical, leadership, history and meditation books; I would recommend some good books for technology leaders, developers and testers. Will share
                                my bookshelf later.

                                to others; I hope it can bring value and inspire others to do the same or different things to make our life, the place where we live
                                (and the world - I am not sure about what it is but just saying here) become better life, better place to live. <i class="fab fa-smile"></i>
